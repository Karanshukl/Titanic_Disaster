# Titanic Disaster Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this dataset provides an opportunity to analyze what factors influenced survival rates.

## Dataset
Data Source: [Download Here ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

The dataset consists of information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes features such as:


- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Name of the passenger
- Sex: Gender of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger
- SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones.
3. Model Selection: Comparing various algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM).
4. Model Training: Training the selected model on the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluation: Using cross-validation and performance metrics to assess the model.
6. Prediction: Generating predictions for the test set.
